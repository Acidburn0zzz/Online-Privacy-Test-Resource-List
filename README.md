## Privacy Online Test And Resource Compendium

The list is designed to show all available and useful online/offline tests in order to build strategies to harden your OS/Internet/Browser configuration against fingerprinting methods. Some of those services might collect only data to hand/sell it to 3th-party developer or people which pay for it to use it for 'bad' things, such services are (if known) marked and aren't preferable added - so keep this in mind before you request a site. 

POTARC itself is more a community driven project because everyone can contribute to it and no pull request or discussion will be rejected, only with good reasons like spamming, etc. This project does not accept any donations because we all doing this in our free time and it's up to everyone to provide some information or not, from my perspective the information should be available for free.

Keep in mind that reducing the fingerprint doesn't mean you're secured against all attacks (including new upcoming ones) because security is a process and not something you gain by installing the correct extensions, plugins or programs.

## Contribution

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Online-Privacy-Test-Resource-List/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Before you create a new issue ticket, ensure you read the issue template and check if the things you like to request is not already on the todo list in order to avoid duplicates or already known things. 


## How to handle the information and test results?

Collection of [device fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) from web clients  such as browser software mostly relies on the availability of JavaScript or similar client-side scripting language for the harvesting of a suitably large number of parameters. Overall this means if only one or a small of things are detectable it not automatically reveals your real identify, but all together can be pretty dangerous in order to expose you or your security setup. Keep in mind that it's not a good idea to share the results or to leak information which setup you exactly use.

The document section is for research and evidence purposes, topics without any proof are not reliable and the project doesn't accept any submissions without any documents or research based on the matter.

#### Keep in mind
> Some of the integrated services & pages collect the results and store it offline and some other pages even sell the results to 3rd-parties! I'm not responsible for this behavior, the list added an indicator in order to inform you.

### Already fixed within the Browser (ensure you using the latest product [always])
* ~~* Detection of incognito mode~~
* ~~SSL / TLS (ciphers) [if you only browsing on pages like GitHub ~ you can even more '[harden](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sheffer-tls-bcp-00)' it]~~ TLS 1.3 is the new common default and most platforms abbandoned TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2 
* OpenSSL fixed (heartbleed,...) 
* Tor (several fingerprint methods are still possible, it's on the todo and will be fixed soon (?))
* Java/Adobe Flash, both are dead and replaced by HTML5 (which has it's own weaknesses) 
* HTML5 which includes stuff like Canvas, Fonts & more (will never be fixed, you have to use  in order to spoof such data)
* Cookies in general are not fixable since your visited page may need it, Amazon for shopping as an example (addons/filter-lists may help to whitelist). But you can disable the cookie collection and work instead with a whitelist, every Browser does support this. Some pages like [Facebook already started to track user via first-party cookies](https://marketingland.com/facebook-to-release-first-party-pixel-for-ads-web-analytics-from-browsers-like-safari-249478).  
* CPU & Mouse wheel fingerprinting which needs to be fixed also within the OS (this is a wontfix!) 
* Network layer based leaks like MAC address leakage. Disabling/blocking IPv6, if not necessary/needed is enough. See [RFC 3041](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3041).
* WebRTC since Chrome 48+ and Firefox 42+, both getting an new menu to allow it per-page (whitelist). There exist also for both several addons, workarounds to compile it without WebRTC support). [Unofficial Chromium builds](http://chromium.woolyss.com) also come without WebRTC or sync.
* PopUps aren't possible anymore, if not Canvas/JS related). You see a permission dialog or can control this behavior directly via Browser settings. Some [Browsers also come with their own Ads-blocking feature](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17011266/google-chrome-ad-blocker-features).
* Browser based download attacks by exposing sensible information.
* Third-party cookie "isolation" (blocking)
* HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) sniffing attacks (removed in Chrome 72+)
* File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - Will be removed soon or later from every Browser.
